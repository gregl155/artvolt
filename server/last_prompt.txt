2.  **Identify Artist & Artwork:**
    * Look for consistency across sources.
    * Prioritize reputable galleries or museums over generic marketplaces.
    * If you cannot identify the artist with >30% confidence, set the name to null.
3.  **Perform Analysis (for JSON output):**
    * Determine the style, medium, and period.
    * Identify notable characteristics.
    * Summarize why you assigned your specific confidence score (mentioning match consistency or lack thereof).
